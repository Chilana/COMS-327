This is the pokemon game but now you can move from map to map. 
Walking into any gate will take to a new map in that direction, located in the 401 by 401 grid of maps.
When the user inputs f, they can type the x and y coordinates and will be trasnported to that map.
There are no issues, sometimes it will take a little bit to load a map but eventaully the map will load.
Also when using the fly method you will have to press enter after typing the coordinates and then move for the 
new map to load.
